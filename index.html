<h1>Delaunay Triangulation Splitter</h1>

<h2>By Alan Pierce</h2>

<p> Add red and blue points to the area below, and then hit enter and press
space over and over to step through and algorithm that finds the Delaunay
triangulation of just the red points and the Delaunay triangulation of just the
blue points.</p>

<p> Note that this is still a work in progress. There are plenty of known
potential improvements and possible bugs. </p>

The complete algorithm, and its analysis, are described in the paper
"Splitting a Delaunay Triangulation in Linear Time", by B. Chazelle,
O. Devillers, F. Hurtado, M. Mora, V. Sacristan, and M. Teillaud.
